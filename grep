This displays every line in pgm.s whose first character is a letter:
         grep  "^[a-zA-Z]"  pgm.s
         
This displays every line in pgm.s whose first character is not a # (pound sign):
  grep -v "^#" pgm.s 
  
To display all lines in the file1 file that match either the abc or xyz string, enter:
 grep -E "abc|xyz" file1
 
 To search for a $ (dollar sign) in the file named test2, enter:
   grep \\$ test2
   
            The \\ (double backslash) characters are necessary in order to force the shell to pass a \$ (single
            backslash, dollar sign) to the grep command. The \ (single backslash) character tells the grep
            command to treat the following character (in this example the $) as a literal character rather than
            an expression character. Use the fgrep command to avoid the necessity of using escape characters
            such as the backslash.
            
   To search recursively through /tmp to find files which have the word IBM without recursing through
            links pointing to directories, type:

            grep R IBM /tmp
            OR

            grep r -H IBM /tmp  
            
 To search recursively through /tmp to find files which have the word IBM and recurse through links
            as well, type:

            grep r IBM /tmp
            OR

            grep -R -L IBM /tmp
